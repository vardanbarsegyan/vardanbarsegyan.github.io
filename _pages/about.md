Dear visitor, welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Vardan Barsegyan; I am a sociology researcher (PhD, 2016). I conduct quantitative research in political inequality, social inequality, mobility, voluntary and forced migration. I analyze survey and administrative data in R, STATA, Python, and Mplus.   

I am currently working as a [social science researcher](https://www.wodc.nl/over-het-wodc/organisatie/medewerkers/vardan-barsegyan) at the WODC Research and Data Centre - the knowledge centre in the field of justice and security in the Netherlands. In 2019-2023, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [department of sociology at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/sociology) (Utrecht, the Netherlands). 

I was born in Armenia (Soviet Union) in 1990, studied and grew up in Russia. I have been living in the Netherlands since 2016. 


My research interests  
======
I study how social inequality translates into political inequality. More particularly, how political participation of people is shaped by their social origin, income, education, and occupational status.   

I also study how educational outcomes of students are shaped by their cognitive ability, social (family) origin, and their interplay. For example, I study differences in educational outcomes of first-generation students and continuous-generation students.  

Finally, voluntary and forced migration is another component of my research interests. I study the causes and consequences of (in)voluntary migration both for the origin and for the host societies.  

I mostly use survey and administrative data, including twin-data. I apply a wide range of quantitative methods including structural equation modeling, latent variable analysis, longitudinal, panel, and multilevel analysis, and behavioral genetic methods.
