## ANTI-WAR STATEMENT AGAINST THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE
With some Russian and Russian speaking sociologists, we initiated an anti-war statement against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The statement is published here.

[The statement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhX7m_c2SEiEqbTAcnz2DKba6WM-kBdo2RboQgklwP7hzBYQ/viewform) is originally written in Russian. This is an English translation: 


Statement by Russian and Russian-speaking sociologists and other social scientists on Russian military invasion of Ukraine

We, Russian and Russian-speaking sociologists and social scientists, condemn the war and call for a halt to military action and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. 

We stand in solidarity with the anti-war statements of our Russian and Russian-speaking colleagues - political scientists, historians, economists and many others, and we join with the anti-war statements of our fellow sociologists around the world - members of the International Sociological Association and the European Sociological Association.
